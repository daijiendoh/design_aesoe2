# Design oligomers for AESOE2

"design_aesoe2_oligo.rb" is a design program for joining oligomers with Ruby

"AESOE2 is a artifitial gene synthesis method"

# DEMO

ruby design_aesoe2_oligo.rb tgtseq.fasta

# Features

"AESOE2 is reliable medhod for synthesis of artificial gene. Author checked successful synthesis up to 2kbp. Using this program, anyone can make csv including oligomer-set from a fasta-file."

# Requirement

* ruby 3.1.2p20 or later
* gem: oj, bio, csv
* gibbs.oj

# Installation

gem install oj bio csv

# Usage

ruby design_aesoe2_oligo.rb <fasta file>

# Note

If the program does not run, or if it stops halfway through and aesoe2_oligo.csv is not generated, please email the author with the last line of the command line attached.
